# Supply Chain Tracker

## Project Description
Supply Chain Tracker is a decentralized application (DApp) built using Ethereum smart contracts that allows stakeholders to track the journey of products through a supply chain — from manufacturing to delivery.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to provide a transparent, immutable, and tamper-proof tracking system that enhances trust between manufacturers, suppliers, and consumers in global supply chains.

## Key Features
- ✅ Add and register new products on the blockchain
- 🔄 Update product status across stages (Manufactured, InTransit, Delivered)
- 🔍 View product details and current status via smart contract

## Future Scope
- 🌍 Integration with IoT devices for automated status updates
- 📲 Front-end DApp interface using web3.js or ethers.js
- 🧾 Role-based access control for different supply chain participants
- 🔐 Enhanced security and privacy for sensitive product data
